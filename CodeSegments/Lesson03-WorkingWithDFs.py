## Creating Data
We will be creating our own test data for analysis.
## Part 3:
# set seed
np.seed(111)

##################################################

# Function to generate test data
def CreateDataSet(Number=1):
    
    Output = []
    
    for i in range(Number):
        
        # Create a weekly (mondays) date range
        rng = pd.date_range(start='1/1/2009', end='12/31/2012', freq='W-MON')
        
        # Create random data
        data = np.randint(low=25,high=1000,size=len(rng))
        
        # Status pool
        status = [1,2,3]
        
        # Make a random list of statuses
        random_status = [status[np.randint(low=0,high=len(status))] for i in range(len(rng))]
        
        # State pool
        states = ['GA','FL','fl','NY','NJ','TX']
        
        # Make a random list of states 
        random_states = [states[np.randint(low=0,high=len(states))] for i in range(len(rng))]
    
        Output.extend(zip(random_states, random_status, data, rng))
        
    return Output

#############################

## Now that we have a function to generate our test data, lets create some data and stick it into a dataframe.

## Part 4:
dataset = CreateDataSet(4)
myDF = pd.DataFrame(data=dataset, columns=['State','Status','CustomerCount','StatusDate'])
myDF.info()

############################

## Part 5:
myDF.head()


# We are now going to save this dataframe into an Excel file, to then bring it back to a dataframe. 
# We simply do this to show you how to read and write to Excel files.
# We do not write the index values of the dataframe to the Excel file, since they are not meant to be part 
#    of our initial test data set.

## Part 6:
# Save results to excel
myDF.to_excel('Lesson3.xlsx', index=False)
print('Done')

#########################################################################

## Grab Data from Excel
## We will be using the read_excel function to read in data from an Excel file. 
## The function allows you to read in specfic tabs by name or location.

## Part 7:
pd.read_excel?

## Note: The location on the Excel file will be in the same folder as the notebook, unless specified otherwise.

## Part 8:
# Location of file
Location = r'C:\Users\david\notebooks\update\Lesson3.xlsx'

# Parse a specific sheet
myDF = pd.read_excel(Location, 0, index_col='StatusDate')
myDF.dtypes


## Part 9:
myDF.index

## Part 10:
myDF.head()

## Prepare Data
## This section attempts to clean up the data for analysis.

## Make sure the state column is all in upper case
## Only select records where the account status is equal to "1"
## Merge (NJ and NY) to NY in the state column
## Remove any outliers (any odd results in the data set)
## Lets take a quick look on how some of the State values are upper case and some are lower case

## Part 11:
myDF['State'].unique()

## To convert all the State values to upper case we will use the upper() function and the dataframe's apply attribute. 
## The lambda function simply will apply the upper function to each value in the State column.

## Part 12:
# Clean State Column, convert to upper case
myDF['State'] = myDF.State.apply(lambda x: x.upper())
## Part 13:
myDF['State'].unique()

## Part 14:
# Only grab where Status == 1
mask = myDF['Status'] == 1
myDF = myDF[mask]

[myDF.State == 'NJ'] ##- Find all records in the State column where they are equal to NJ.
myDF.State[myDF.State == 'NJ'] = 'NY' ##- For all records in the State column where they are equal to NJ, replace them with NY.

## Part 15:
# Convert NJ to NY
mask = myDF.State == 'NJ'
myDF['State'][mask] = 'NY'

# Now we can see we have a much cleaner data set to work with.

## Part 16:
myDF['State'].unique()

## At this point we may want to graph the data to check for any outliers or inconsistencies in the data. 
## We will be using the plot() attribute of the dataframe.
##
## As you can see from the graph below it is not very conclusive and is probably a sign that we need
##   to perform some more data preparation.

## Part 17:
myDF['CustomerCount'].plot(figsize=(15,5));

## If we take a look at the data, we begin to realize that there are multiple values for the same 
##    State, StatusDate, and Status combination. 
## It is possible that this means the data you are working with is dirty/bad/inaccurate, but we will assume otherwise.
## We can assume this data set is a subset of a bigger data set and if we simply add the values in the CustomerCount 
##     column per State, StatusDate, and Status we will get the Total Customer Count per day.

## Part 18:
sortmyDF = myDF[myDF['State']=='NY'].sort_index(axis=0)
sortmyDF.head(10)

#################################
# Our task is now to create a new dataframe that compresses the data so we have daily customer counts per State and StatusDate. 
# We can ignore the Status column since all the values in this column are of value 1. 
# To accomplish this we will use the dataframe's functions groupby and sum().

# Note that we had to use reset_index . 
# If we did not, we would not have been able to group by both the State and the StatusDate since the groupby 
#   function expects only columns as inputs. The reset_index function will bring the index StatusDate 
#   back to a column in the dataframe.

## Part 19:
# Group by State and StatusDate
Daily = myDF.reset_index().groupby(['State','StatusDate']).sum()
Daily.head()

###################################
The State and StatusDate columns are automatically placed in the index of the Daily dataframe. You can think of the index as the primary key of a database table but without the constraint of having unique values. Columns in the index as you will see allow us to easily select, plot, and perform calculations on the data.

Below we delete the Status column since it is all equal to one and no longer necessary.

## Part 20:
del Daily['Status']
Daily.head()

## Part 21:
# What is the index of the dataframe
Daily.index

## Part 22:
# Select the State index
Daily.index.levels[0]

## Part 23:
# Select the StatusDate index
Daily.index.levels[1]
####################################################

# Lets now plot the data per State.

As you can see by breaking the graph up by the State column we have a much clearer picture on how the data looks like. Can you spot any outliers?

## Part 24:
Daily.loc['FL'].plot()
Daily.loc['GA'].plot()
Daily.loc['NY'].plot()
Daily.loc['TX'].plot();




# We can also just plot the data on a specific date, like 2012. 
# We can now clearly see that the data for these states is all over the place. 
#Since the data consist of weekly customer counts, the variability of the data seems suspect. For this tutorial we will assume bad data and proceed.

## Part 25:
Daily.loc['FL']['2012':].plot()
Daily.loc['GA']['2012':].plot()
Daily.loc['NY']['2012':].plot()
Daily.loc['TX']['2012':].plot();




We will assume that per month the customer count should remain relatively steady. Any data outside a specific range in that month will be removed from the data set. The final result should have smooth graphs with no spikes.

### StateYearMonth - Here we group by State, Year of StatusDate, and Month of StatusDate.
Daily['Outlier'] - A boolean (True or False) value letting us know if the value in the CustomerCount column is ouside the acceptable range.

### We will be using the attribute transform instead of apply. The reason is that transform will keep the shape(# of rows and columns) of the dataframe the same and apply will not. By looking at the previous graphs, we can realize they are not resembling a gaussian distribution, this means we cannot use summary statistics like the mean and stDev. We use percentiles instead. Note that we run the risk of eliminating good data.

## Part 26:
# Calculate Outliers
StateYearMonth = Daily.groupby([Daily.index.get_level_values(0), Daily.index.get_level_values(1).year, Daily.index.get_level_values(1).month])
Daily['Lower'] = StateYearMonth['CustomerCount'].transform( lambda x: x.quantile(q=.25) - (1.5*x.quantile(q=.75)-x.quantile(q=.25)) )
Daily['Upper'] = StateYearMonth['CustomerCount'].transform( lambda x: x.quantile(q=.75) + (1.5*x.quantile(q=.75)-x.quantile(q=.25)) )
Daily['Outlier'] = (Daily['CustomerCount'] < Daily['Lower']) | (Daily['CustomerCount'] > Daily['Upper']) 

# Remove Outliers
Daily = Daily[Daily['Outlier'] == False]
The dataframe named Daily will hold customer counts that have been aggregated per day. The original data (myDF) has multiple records per day. We are left with a data set that is indexed by both the state and the StatusDate. The Outlier column should be equal to False signifying that the record is not an outlier.

## Part 27:
Daily.head()
Out[27:
CustomerCount	Lower	Upper	Outlier
State	StatusDate				
FL	2009-01-12	901	450.5	1351.5	False
2009-02-02	653	326.5	979.5	False
2009-03-23	752	376.0	1128.0	False
2009-04-06	1086	543.0	1629.0	False
2009-06-08	649	324.5	973.5	False
We create a separate dataframe named ALL which groups the Daily dataframe by StatusDate. We are essentially getting rid of the State column. The Max column represents the maximum customer count per month. The Max column is used to smooth out the graph.

## Part 28:
# Combine all markets

# Get the max customer count by Date
ALL = pd.DataFrame(Daily['CustomerCount'].groupby(Daily.index.get_level_values(1)).sum())
ALL.columns = ['CustomerCount'] # rename column

# Group by Year and Month
YearMonth = ALL.groupby([lambda x: x.year, lambda x: x.month])

# What is the max customer count per Year and Month
ALL['Max'] = YearMonth['CustomerCount'].transform(lambda x: x.max())
ALL.head()


As you can see from the ALL dataframe above, in the month of January 2009, the maximum customer count was 901. If we had used apply, we would have got a dataframe with (Year and Month) as the index and just the Max column with the value of 901.

There is also an interest to gauge if the current customer counts were reaching certain goals the company had established. The task here is to visually show if the current customer counts are meeting the goals listed below. We will call the goals BHAG (Big Hairy Annual Goal).

12/31/2011 - 1,000 customers
12/31/2012 - 2,000 customers
12/31/2013 - 3,000 customers
We will be using the date_range function to create our dates.

Definition: date_range(start=None, end=None, periods=None, freq='D', tz=None, normalize=False, name=None, closed=None)
Docstring: Return a fixed frequency datetime index, with day (calendar) as the default frequency

By choosing the frequency to be A or annual we will be able to get the three target dates from above.

## Part 37:
pd.date_range?
## Part 30:
# Create the BHAG dataframe
data = [1000,2000,3000]
idx = pd.date_range(start='12/31/2011', end='12/31/2013', freq='A')
BHAG = pd.DataFrame(data, index=idx, columns=['BHAG'])
BHAG

Combining dataframes as we have learned in previous lesson is made simple using the concat function. Remember when we choose axis = 0 we are appending row wise.

## Part 31:
# Combine the BHAG and the ALL data set 
combined = pd.concat([ALL,BHAG], axis=0)
combined = combined.sort_index(axis=0)
combined.tail()

## Part 32:
fig, axes = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 7))

combined['BHAG'].fillna(method='pad').plot(color='green', label='BHAG')
combined['Max'].plot(color='blue', label='All Markets')
plt.legend(loc='best');

There was also a need to forecast next year's customer count and we can do this in a couple of simple steps. We will first group the combined dataframe by Year and place the maximum customer count for that year. This will give us one row per Year.

## Part 33:
# Group by Year and then get the max value per year
Year = combined.groupby(lambda x: x.year).max()
Year

## Part 34:
# Add a column representing the percent change per year
Year['YR_PCT_Change'] = Year['Max'].pct_change(periods=1)
Year

########################################################

# To get next year's end customer count we will assume our current growth rate remains constant. 
# We then will increase this years customer count by that amount and that will be our forecast for next year.

## Part 35:
(1 + Year.ix[2012,'YR_PCT_Change']) * Year.ix[2012,'Max']

#######################################################

## Present Data
Create individual Graphs per State.

## Part 36:
# First Graph
ALL['Max'].plot(figsize=(10, 5));plt.title('ALL Markets')

# Last four Graphs
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=2, figsize=(20, 10))
fig.subplots_adjust(hspace=1.0) ## Create space between plots

Daily.loc['FL']['CustomerCount']['2012':].fillna(method='pad').plot(ax=axes[0,0])
Daily.loc['GA']['CustomerCount']['2012':].fillna(method='pad').plot(ax=axes[0,1]) 
Daily.loc['TX']['CustomerCount']['2012':].fillna(method='pad').plot(ax=axes[1,0]) 
Daily.loc['NY']['CustomerCount']['2012':].fillna(method='pad').plot(ax=axes[1,1]) 

# Add titles
axes[0,0].set_title('Florida')
axes[0,1].set_title('Georgia')
axes[1,0].set_title('Texas')
axes[1,1].set_title('North East');
