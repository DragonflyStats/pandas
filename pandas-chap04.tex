\section{NumPy Basics: Arrays and Vectorized Computation}

NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is the fundamental package required for high
performance scientific computing and data analysis. It is the foundation on which
nearly all of the higher-level tools in this book are built. Here are some of the things it
provides:

\begin{itemize}
\item ndarray, a fast and space-efficient multidimensional array providing vectorized
arithmetic operations and sophisticated broadcasting capabilities
\item Standard mathematical functions for fast operations on entire arrays of data
without having to write loops
\item Tools for reading / writing array data to disk and working with memory-mapped
files
\item Linear algebra, random number generation, and Fourier transform capabilities
\item Tools for integrating code written in C, C++, and Fortran
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Basic Indexing and Slicing}
NumPy array indexing is a rich topic, as there are many ways you may want to select
a subset of your data or individual elements. One-dimensional arrays are simple; on
the surface they act similarly to Python lists.

\subsection{Data Processing Using Arrays}
Using NumPy arrays enables you to express many kinds of data processing tasks as
concise array expressions that might otherwise require writing loops. This practice of
replacing explicit loops with array expressions is commonly referred to as vectorization.
In general, vectorized array operations will often be one or two (or more) orders
of magnitude faster than their pure Python equivalents, with the biggest impact in any
kind of numerical computations.
