\section{Statsmodels}
Statsmodels is a Python module that allows users to explore data, estimate statistical models, and perform statistical tests. 
An extensive list of descriptive statistics, statistical tests, plotting functions, and result statistics are available for different types of 
data and each estimator. Researchers across fields may find that statsmodels fully meets their needs for statistical computing and data analysis 
in Python. Features include:


\begin{itemize}

\item Linear regression models

\item Generalized linear models

\item Discrete choice models

\item Robust linear models

\item Many models and functions for time series analysis

\item Nonparametric estimators

\item A collection of datasets for examples

\item A wide range of statistical tests

\item Input-output tools for producing tables in a number of formats (Text, LaTex, HTML) and for reading Stata files into NumPy and Pandas.

\item Plotting functions

\item Extensive unit tests to ensure correctness of results

\item Many more models and extensions in development

\end{itemize}
